# Lattke et al.: Single-Cell Multiomic Atlas of Human Cortical Development in Down Syndrome – Documentation Analysis Pipelines

These pipelines have been used to analyse our 10X Genomics single cell multiome dataset from human brain tissue of Down syndrome and disomic control fetuses (Lattke et al., XYZ). The pipelines include basic processing and clustering, mapping to reference atlases, differential gene expression, and gene regulatory network analyses integrating chromatin accessibility data to identify upstream regulators of deregulated transcriptional programmes. Also included are optional/auxiliary scripts for comparing bulk and scRNA-seq datasets from human cell models with the tissue dataset, and a pipeline for quantifying nuclear fluorescence intensity from immunostainings, used to validate the reduction of a neuronal population expressing the transcription factor FOXP1, and the deregulation of this factor, in DS fetal brain tissue.
