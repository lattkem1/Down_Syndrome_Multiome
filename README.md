# Single cell multiome analysis pipeline
## from Lattke et al.: Single-Cell Multiomic Atlas of Human Cortical Development in Down Syndrome 

This pipeline has been used to analyse our 10X Genomics single cell multiome dataset from human brain tissue of Down syndrome and disomic control foetuses. It includes basic processing, differential gene expression and chromatin accessibility analyses, network analyses to identify upstream regulators of deregulated programmes, and a comparison with human cell models (Lattke et al., bioRxiv, 2024).
